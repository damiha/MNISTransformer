# MNIST Image Generation with Transformers

This project focuses on generating MNIST digit images using transformer models. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), serves as a standard benchmark for image generation tasks. By leveraging the capabilities of transformers, this project aims to synthesize high-fidelity digit images that closely mimic the authentic MNIST data.

## Samples

Below are sample generated images for each digit from 0 to 9, showcasing the transformer model's capability to generate MNIST-like digit images. These images were generated after training the model with specified hyperparameters and methodology.

To add the actual images in the README.md, you need to ensure that the image paths are correctly referenced relative to the location of the README.md file in your project directory. If the README.md is at the root of your project and the images are stored in `sample_img/` directly under the root, then the paths provided above are correct. Adjust the paths as necessary based on your project's directory structure.
